Hello.

I am **Nguyen Nguyen**, or "Wen" for short. I have been a **Software Engineer**
since 2011. Currently, I am coding at [HERE Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/3237134/) in Chicago.
At work, I write clean code for web applications, web services and distributed systems.
I also build, package, deploy and monitor software on the cloud. 
When I'm not coding or tinkering with software, I brush up on my Japanese.

You can find more about me professionally 
on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyensquared/). 
Or maybe find something interesting 
on my [Github](https://github.com/wenn).
